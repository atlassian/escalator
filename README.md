# Escalator
Batch Optimized Horizontal Autoscaler for Kubernetes

Escalator is a cluster-level autoscaler for Kubernetes that is designed for batch workloads that cannot be fast-drained. Kubernetes is a container orchestration framework that schedules Docker containers on a cluster.

The key preliminary features are:

- Cluster-level utilisation node scaling.
- Safely drain "sacred" pods from nodes to allow graceful termination
- Designed to work on selected auto-scaling groups, to allow the default Kubernetes autoscaler to continue to scale our service based workloads
- Automatically cycle oldest nodes

The need for this autoscaler is dervied from our own experiences with very large batch workloads being scheduled that can't be force-drained by the default autoscaler.

## Documentation and Design
See [Docs](docs/)

## How to run

### Locally
```
go run cmd/main.go --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --nodegroups nodegroups.yaml
```

### Docker
```
# will build and push the docker image to the registry
make push
```
In the escalator-deployment:
```
# need to mount your config file to your container
- image: docker.atl-paas.net/kitt/escalator:{{ escalator.version }}
  command:
  - ./main
  - --nodegroups
  - /opt/conf/nodegroups/nodegroups_config.yaml
```

## How to test
#### Test everything
```
make test
```
#### Test a specific package
```
go test ./pkg/<package-name> 
```
